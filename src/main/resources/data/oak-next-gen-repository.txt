Jackrabbit Oak - the next generation content repository
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content repository
for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding content applications.
The Oak effort is a part of the Apache Jackrabbit project. Apache
Jackrabbit is a project of the Apache Software Foundation.
Why Oak
Jackrabbit 2.x is a solid and feature-rich content repository that works well especially for the
needs of traditional web sites and integrated content management applications. However, the trends
in user expectations (especially for personalized, interactive and collaborative content),
application architectures (distributed, loosely coupled, multi-platform solutions with lots of data)
and hardware design (horizontal rather than vertical scaling) have rendered some of the original
Jackrabbit design decisions (which date back almost a decade) obsolete and there is no easy way to
incrementally update the design.
Jackrabbit Oak aims to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content repository for use
as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding content applications. The
repository should implement standards like JCR, WebDAV and CMIS, and be easily accessible from
various platforms, especially from JavaScript clients running in modern browser environments. The
implementation should provide more out-of-the-box functionality than typical NoSQL databases while
achieving comparable levels of scalability and performance.
