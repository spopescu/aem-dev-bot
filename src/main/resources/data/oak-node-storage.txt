Node Storage
Oak comes with two node storage flavours: Segment and
Document. Segment storage is optimised for maximal
performance in standalone deployments, and document storage is optimised for
maximal scalability in clustered deployments.
NodeStore API
The node storage implement the NodeStore APIs.
Those are ultimately representations of the
node state model.
The NodeStore exposes its functionality through a pure Java API,
which is suited to work with in Java, and has lower performance and memory overhead.
MicroKernel API
The MicroKernel API was deprecated in OAK 1.2 and dropped from the project as of
Oak 1.3.0. It used to exposes its functionality through a String only (JSON) API.
